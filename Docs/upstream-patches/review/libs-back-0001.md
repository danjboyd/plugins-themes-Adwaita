# Review: libs-back patch 1

**Item:** libs-back 0001, "x11: keep the window manager functions of windows the gui decorates"
**Commit:** `dbfbe5397bc18895ef3e49951574e312603b03fa`
**Base:** libs-back master `9731f15`
**Where:** branch `ai-policy/csd-series` in `~/git/gnustep/libs-back-series`; patch file `Docs/upstream-patches/libs-back/0001-x11-keep-the-window-manager-functions-of-windows-the.patch`
**Files:** `Source/x11/XGServerWindow.m` (+14 −2), `ChangeLog` (+11), `Tests/x11/motifhints.m` (new, 180 lines)

This is the version to sign off on. It replaces `813163e`, which had three inaccurate statements in its commit message. The code and the test are byte-for-byte the same as in `813163e` (the commits' trees are identical), so the results below, run on `813163e` and master, apply to this commit unchanged.

Prepared under `Docs/UPSTREAM_POLICY.md`. Nothing has been sent.

## The problem

When GNUstep draws a window's title bar itself (`GSBackHandlesWindowDecorations NO`, which the Adwaita theme needs), libs-back puts a `_MOTIF_WM_HINTS` property on each window. That property has two fields that matter here:

- `decorations`: what the window manager should draw (its title bar and borders);
- `functions`: what the window manager may do to the window (move, resize, minimize, maximize, close).

libs-back set both to 0 for every window it decorates, as it does for borderless windows. "Draw no frame" is right. "Allow no functions" is the bug: GNOME's window manager then refuses to move, minimize, maximize or close the window, however it is asked (double-click on the title bar, Super-drag, its window menu, the requests a theme sends). GNUstep's own title bar didn't notice, because it moves the window itself (`-setFrameOrigin:`, carried out with `XMoveResizeWindow`), which the hints don't restrict.

## The fix, hunk by hunk

The function is `setWindowHintsForStyle()` in `Source/x11/XGServerWindow.m`. It is quoted whole below the patch.

1. **The first branch (line 344).** It read `if (styleMask == NSBorderlessWindowMask || !handlesWindowDecorations)`, which gave every window GNUstep decorates the borderless treatment: decorations 0, functions 0. The patch removes `|| !handlesWindowDecorations`; only borderless windows take that branch now.
2. **The new block (line 388).** Styled windows go through the existing per-style branches, which add a function for each part of the style: titled gives move, closable gives close (and move), miniaturizable gives minimize, resizable gives resize and maximize. These branches also ask for decorations (title, border and so on). The new block runs after them when the gui draws the decorations: it sets `decorations = 0`, keeps the functions the style earned, and adds move.
3. **What doesn't change:**
   - The icon window and mini window branches come after the new block and still set everything to 0, so those windows stay locked.
   - When the window manager draws the decorations (`handlesWindowDecorations` YES), the new block doesn't run, so nothing changes in that mode.
   - Borderless windows (menus, tool tips) still allow nothing.

## Who this affects

Everyone who runs GNUstep with the gui drawing the decorations (`GSBackHandlesWindowDecorations` or `GSX11HandlesWindowDecorations` NO), not only the Adwaita theme. Every styled window, sheets and utility panels included, now lets the window manager move it, and resize, minimize, maximize or close it as its style allows. Before, it allowed nothing. The commit message says so.

**To weigh:** a sheet can now be moved by the window manager on its own, for example with Super-drag, away from the window it belongs to. The commit message names sheets among the windows that change, but not this case.

## The test: `Tests/x11/motifhints.m`

- **What it does:** turns GNUstep-drawn decorations on for its own process only (in the argument domain, so nothing is written to the user's defaults), creates windows of four styles, and reads back each window's `_MOTIF_WM_HINTS` as "flags functions decorations", compared exactly:

  | Style | Expected | Meaning |
  |---|---|---|
  | titled, closable, miniaturizable, resizable | `3 62 0` | no decorations; move, resize, minimize, maximize, close |
  | titled, closable | `3 36 0` | no decorations; move, close |
  | titled | `3 4 0` | no decorations; move |
  | borderless | `3 0 0` | no decorations; nothing |

  It also checks that the backend reports the gui as drawing the decorations, so the test can't pass by running in the wrong mode.
- **Why that is enough:** the exact comparison catches both halves of the bug (functions missing, or decorations asked for). The borderless case guards against the fix spreading to windows that must stay locked.
- **A detail you may be asked about:** it flushes the backend's own X connection before reading. Without that, the property can still be in the backend's buffer and the read finds nothing.
- **What it needs:** a display; no particular window manager, since it only reads what the backend sets.
- **Not covered:** the icon and mini window branches; window managers other than Mutter.

## Results, each run on 2026-10-06

| Check | Without the patch (master `9731f15`) | With the patch |
|---|---|---|
| `Tests/x11/motifhints.m` | 3 of 5 fail (each reads `3 0 0`) | 5 of 5 pass |
| GNOME Shell 48.7 (X11), GNUstep theme, gui drawing the decorations: Mutter's `_NET_WM_ALLOWED_ACTIONS` | resize, fullscreen, change desktop, above, below (no move, maximize, minimize or close) | includes move, maximize and close |
| `gcc-syntax-check.sh` on this commit | — | clean (canary rejected) |
| This commit alone: build, whole `Tests/x11` | — | builds; 54 passed, 0 failed |

The GNOME Shell run used the GNUstep theme on purpose: the Adwaita theme works around this bug itself (`GnomeThemeWindowManagerAllowFunctions`), which would hide it. Minimize isn't in what that check looks for.

## What changed since the first packet (`813163e` → `dbfbe53`)

Only the commit message:

1. "Mutter's `_NET_WM_ALLOWED_ACTIONS` lists none of them" became "lists resize, but not move, minimize, maximize or close", as the run shows.
2. "moves the window with `XMoveWindow`" became "`-setFrameOrigin:`, which `-placewindow::` carries out with `XMoveResizeWindow`", as the code shows.
3. "as GTK's client-side decorated windows do" was dropped: nobody checked what GTK puts in that property.
4. The Testing section gained the GNOME Shell result, so the claim about Mutter rests on a run.

## Questions to be able to answer

- Why not leave the functions field out entirely (no `MWM_HINTS_FUNCTIONS` flag), as the window manager then allows everything? *The style's limits still mean something: a window that isn't resizable shouldn't be resized by the window manager either. Leaving the field out would allow everything.*
- Why add move to every styled window? *Every styled window can be moved with GNUstep's own title bar. Without move, the window manager can't do the same thing for it: drag-to-move handed to it, Super-drag, keyboard moves.*
- Does anything change when the window manager draws the decorations? *No. The new block only runs when the gui draws them, and the first branch changes only for that mode.*

## To check it yourself

```
cd ~/git/gnustep/libs-back-series
git show dbfbe53                                   # the whole commit
git show dbfbe53:Source/x11/XGServerWindow.m | sed -n 312,427p   # the function
```

The test needs a private display; the packet's results came from `run-back-tests.sh` in the session's scratch directory. Ask Claude to run it with you watching if you want to see it.

Subject: [PATCH 1/5] x11: keep the window manager functions of windows the gui
 decorates

With GSBackHandlesWindowDecorations (or GSX11HandlesWindowDecorations)
NO, setWindowHintsForStyle() gave every window the borderless window's
Motif hints: no decorations, which is right, but also functions 0, which
tells the window manager that the window may not be moved, resized,
minimized, maximized or closed.  Mutter follows that for all but resize:
the _NET_WM_ALLOWED_ACTIONS it sets on the window lists resize, but not
move, minimize, maximize or close, so it won't do those for the window,
whether asked through _NET_WM_MOVERESIZE, _NET_WM_STATE, Super-drag or
its window menu.  GNUstep's own title bar moves the window itself
(-setFrameOrigin:, which -placewindow:: carries out with
XMoveResizeWindow), and the hints don't restrict that, so this went
unnoticed.

A styled window the gui decorates now asks for no decorations but keeps
the functions its style allows, plus move.  Borderless windows keep
functions 0.

This changes behaviour for everyone who uses GNUstep-drawn decorations
today: every styled window, sheets and utility panels included, now lets
the window manager move it (and resize, minimize, maximize or close it as
its style allows), where before it allowed nothing.

Testing: Tests/x11/motifhints.m creates windows of four styles with the
gui drawing the decorations and reads back their _MOTIF_WM_HINTS: the
flags, the functions and the decorations, compared exactly.  Exact
comparison catches both halves of the bug (functions missing, or
decorations asked for), and the borderless case guards against the fix
spreading to windows that must stay fixed.  It reads only the property
the backend sets, so it needs a display but no particular window manager.
Without this change the three styled checks fail ("3 0 0", nothing
allowed); with it all five checks pass.

Under GNOME Shell 48.7 (X11), with the GNUstep theme and the gui drawing
the decorations, Mutter's _NET_WM_ALLOWED_ACTIONS for a fully styled
window lists resize, fullscreen, change desktop, above and below without
this change, and includes move, maximize and close with it.

AI assistance: this change, its test and this description were written
with Claude (Anthropic's Claude Code).
