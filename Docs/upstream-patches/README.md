# Upstream patches

The libs-back and libs-gui changes the theme needs for window shadows,
rounded corners, popover shadows for menus, window types and turning
GNUstep-drawn decorations on from a theme (see
`Docs/PROPOSAL_LIBS_BACK_CSD.md` for the design). Prepared for
plugins-themes-Adwaita#13, to follow GNUstep's policy on AI-generated
content (`POLICY_AI.md` in gnustep/apps-gorm; posted to discuss-gnustep by
Gregory Casamento on 2026-03-12, reposted 2026-07-10, and kept in effect on
gnustep-dev on 2026-07-14).

**Sent:** patch 1 as [libs-back#244](https://github.com/gnustep/libs-back/pull/244), 2026-10-06. The rest wait on Dan's own review
(below). On the FSF copyright assignment, Dan decided on 2026-10-06 to
send without it, as GNUstep has already accepted his code, and to deal
with it if a maintainer raises it.

**What would be sent, one pull request each** (in `libs-back-standalone/`
and the libs-back repository of `~/git/gnustep/libs-back-series`; review
packets in `review/`, each with the hash to sign off on):

| Patch | Branch | Commit | On | Packet |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| libs-back 2 | `x11-window-types` | `25affcd` | master `23fbe39` | `review/libs-back-0002.md` |
| libs-back 3 | `x11-borderless-alpha` | `b94dc1b` | master `23fbe39` | `review/libs-back-0003.md` |
| libs-back 4 | `x11-window-shadows` | `fd50897` | patch 3 | `review/libs-back-0004.md` |
| libs-back 5 | `x11-popover-shadows` | `0c7dc1f` | patch 4 | `review/libs-back-0005.md` |
| libs-gui 1 | `ai-policy/theme-backend-defaults` | `bd5a983` | master `549f639` (current) | `review/libs-gui-0001.md` |

2 and 3 stand alone; 4 can only be sent once 3 is merged, and 5 once 4
is. Each differs from its series commit only by what isn't under it (the
ChangeLog entries of the patches before it, and patch 2's method
declaration next to patch 4's) and by corrections that runs disproved:
patch 2's Mutter and Openbox statements, and patch 4's note on which
libs-gui aborts its drawing test and on the GNOME Shell check (see each
packet).

## The series

Made with `git format-patch`; apply with `git am`. Each commit has its own
ChangeLog entry and its own test, builds on its own, and its message says
what the test checks, why that is enough, what it guards against, how
many checks fail without the change, and what isn't covered.

**libs-back** (`libs-back/`), against master `9731f15`, branch
`ai-policy/csd-series` in `~/git/gnustep/libs-back-series`:

| # | Commit | Test | Without / with |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Keep the window manager functions of windows the gui decorates (Motif hints; a bug fix) | `Tests/x11/motifhints.m` | 3 of 5 fail / 5 pass |
| 2 | Type menus, tool tips, drag images and modal panels as GTK does | `Tests/x11/windowtype.m` | 4 of 5 fail / 5 pass |
| 3 | An alpha channel for borderless windows, when a theme asks | `Tests/x11/borderlessalpha.m` | 1 of 4 fails / 4 pass |
| 4 | Window shadows and rounded corners for windows the gui decorates | `Tests/x11/shadowmargin.m`, `Tests/x11/shadowdrawing.m` | 14 of 19 fail, drawing can't run / 19 and 8 pass |
| 5 | Popover shadows for menus, when a theme asks | the same two tests, extended | the popover checks fail / 23 and 14 pass |

1 and 2 stand alone; 4 needs 3 (the 32-bit visual), and 5 needs 4.
Every commit was built and its `x11` tests run on their own (54, 59, 63,
90 and 100 passing, none failing). The whole libs-back suite: 337 passed,
none failed, at the end of the series, against 286 on master; the 51 more
are the new checks. Against the series, the theme's window manager checks
pass under GNOME Shell 48.7 (`make check-mutter-shadow`, 16 checks), KWin
6.3.6 (16), Xfwm4 4.20.0 (17) and Openbox 3.6.1 with picom 12.5 (10)
(`make check-wms` with the shadow libraries; one KWin check is skipped:
its compositor can't be stopped from the test session).

**Changed since 2026-10-06 (2026-10-07, plugins-themes-Adwaita#14):**
patches 4 and 5 (now `251a975` and `1d6dfb3`); 1–3 are unchanged, byte
for byte. Patch 4 sets a margin that grows before the larger size hints,
and one that shrinks after the smaller ones. With the hints first, KWin
restored a maximized window 20 pixels larger each way: it held the
restored window at the new minimum, which includes the margin, and then
grew it by the margin. `shadowmargin.m` gains two checks of that order;
the restore's fails with the patch as it was. Patch 5's message has the
new count only. Upstream master has moved on to `23fbe39` since the
series was made; all five patches still apply to it with `git am`.

**Changed again on 2026-10-07:** patch 2 has the standalone version's two
corrections (its code comment, ChangeLog and message on Openbox's types,
and the message's Mutter sentence), so the series is now `dbfbe53` (1,
unchanged), `7ac2405`, `8589356`, `129aefc` and `9160d53`. Patches 3–5
differ from the previous ones only by those lines, carried forward.
Later the same day patch 4's message got the standalone version's
correction on which libs-gui aborts `shadowdrawing.m` (a libs-gui older
than `8a092cfa7`, not 0.32): the series is now `dbfbe53`, `7ac2405`,
`8589356`, `46dc8b2` and `fd6e241`, with the same trees as before.

**libs-gui** (`libs-gui/`), against master `549f63913`, branch
`ai-policy/theme-backend-defaults` in `~/git/gnustep/libs-gui-series`:

| # | Commit | Test | Without / with |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Let a theme turn GNUstep-drawn window decorations on | `Tests/gui/GSTheme/backendDefaults.m` | doesn't run / 11 pass |

The whole libs-gui suite (2026-10-07): 4829 passed against 4819 on
master, and the same 33 failed tests, 2 aborted files and 1 dashed hope
on both: they are in master already, and the patch adds none (one
NSDataLink pasteboard check failed only while both suites ran at once;
run alone it passes on both).

## How the series meets the policy

| Policy | How |
|---|---|
| 4.2: all AI-assisted contributions must include tests | Every commit has a test in the package's own `gnustep-tests` framework, failing without the change (counts above, each run on a private Xvfb). |
| 4.2: what is tested, why the test is good enough, what failures it guards against | A "Testing:" paragraph in every commit message, plus what the tests don't cover. |
| 4.2: no Apple-specific conventions; the project also uses GCC | No literals, blocks, properties, dot syntax, ARC, fast enumeration or `@autoreleasepool` in any added line (checked by search). Every changed source and test file was run through GCC 14's Objective-C front end (`-fsyntax-only`) with no diagnostic in the file itself; the check was first shown to reject a planted array literal and block. GCC can't parse the installed clang/libobjc2 GNUstep headers fully, so this is a syntax check of our code, not a full GCC build. |
| 4.2 and 7: never open a PR before reviewing the code; be able to explain it | **Dan's to do** (below). The commit messages explain each change for that review. |
| 5: disclose AI assistance | An "AI assistance:" paragraph and a `Co-Authored-By: Claude` line in every commit. |
| 6: no material of unverifiable origin | All code written for these patches. The shadow numbers are measurements of libadwaita 1.7 windows under Mutter and libadwaita's published box-shadow values; no code was taken. Said in commits 4 and 5. |
| 6: no fabricated results | Every count in the commits and here comes from a run. |
| 7: reproduction steps, tests | `make check` steps below; each test's header comment says what display it needs. |
| Richard Frith-Macdonald on gnustep-dev (2026-04-13): one patch per issue, with its test and a ChangeLog entry | One commit per change, each with both. |

Changes made while preparing the series (beyond splitting it):

- **libs-back, found by GCC.** The shadow code called
  `-_checkWMSupports:` above its definition with no declaration. Clang
  accepts that silently; GCC assumes the method returns `id` and accepts
  any arguments, while it returns `BOOL`, so a GCC build could have read
  garbage from the return register. It is now declared with the other
  private methods (upstream did the same for `-_getExtents:`).
- **libs-back, found by running each commit on its own.**
  `borderlessalpha.m` made its "no compositing manager" window before the
  backend had processed the event saying the compositor had gone (the
  backend caches that from commit 4 on); it now lets the run loop turn
  first, as an application would.
- **libs-gui, a bug fix.** The draft tested the user's choice with
  `-objectForKey:`, which also sees the registration domain, so a value an
  application or library registered for `GSBackHandlesWindowDecorations`
  would have kept the theme's from being installed. It now looks only above
  the registration domain. The new test found it. The libs-gui that apps
  run with today (`~/git/gnustep/libs-gui-csd`, and the installed
  `+csd` package) still has the draft's version.
- **Tests set defaults for the test process only**, in the argument domain.
  The draft's `shadowmargin.m` used `-setBool:forKey:`, which would have
  written `GSBackHandlesWindowDecorations NO` and the shadow defaults into
  the defaults of whoever ran `make check`.
- **Tests flush the backend's connection before reading** what it set.
  Without that, "has no margin" checks could pass only because the
  property hadn't arrived yet.
- **New tests:** the Motif hints, the alpha channel and the shadow pixels
  had no test of their own; the drag image's window type had none either.
- The shadow template cache is a small struct instead of macros over
  parallel arrays.
- **libs-back, found under KWin** (2026-10-07, #14): the order of the
  margin and the size hints, above.

## Before sending: Dan's part

Sending follows `Docs/UPSTREAM_POLICY.md`: Dan reviews each commit and signs
off on its hash in `Docs/UPSTREAM_SIGNOFF.md` before anything is sent.
GNUstep's policy puts these on the contributor, and they can't be done for
him:

1. **Review every patch** and be able to explain each change and why it is
   correct (policy 4.2 and 7). The commit messages are written to help.
2. ~~Settle the FSF copyright assignment question (#13).~~ Decided
   2026-10-06: send without it; deal with it if a maintainer asks.
3. **Send one pull request per commit**, libs-back in the order above
   (patch 1 and 2 can go first and alone).
4. Expect libobjc2's maintainer not to take AI-assisted changes; none of
   these touch libobjc2.

## Running the tests

Both packages' tests run with `gnustep-tests` from the package's `Tests`
directory. The x11 tests fork their own stand-in window manager and
compositing manager, so they need a display with neither: a private Xvfb.
Point a copy of `GNUstep.conf` at an empty defaults directory and, for
libs-back, at a user Library whose `Bundles/libgnustep-back-032.bundle`
links to the bundle under test. Make the copy mode 600: libs-base ignores
a config file others can write (it says so on stderr, which
`gnustep-tests` hides) and the tests then load the installed backend.
`LD_DEBUG=files` on a test binary shows which bundle it loaded.

- `x11/shadowdrawing.m` was run against libs-gui master. With a libs-gui
  older than `8a092cfa7` (libs-gui#816) the process aborts before the
  first check (`-[GSCInlineString copy]` sent to a deallocated instance),
  and so does `cairo/pdfps.m`: the font roles kept the backend's default
  font names unretained (`Docs/upstream-issues/12-…`).
