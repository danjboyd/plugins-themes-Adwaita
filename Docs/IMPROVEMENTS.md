# Improvement Backlog

A running list of theme bugs and GNOME-native polish, collected while building
OneDriveServiceManager with this theme (started 2026-09-24). Each item notes how
it was found. Compare against the libadwaita reference with
`python3 Reference/AdwaitaDemo/adwaita_demo.py --page PAGE --screenshot OUT.png`.

## Fixed

| Item | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| Image-only `NSToolbarItem`s drew nothing (image and label) | `GnomeThemeOriginalMethod()`: overrides reached from a subclass (`GSToolbarButtonCell`) found no original method |
| `sizeToFit` buttons clipped their last word ("Sign In" → "Sign") | `cellSize` measures with the drawing geometry (bezel margins + title insets) |
| `sizeToFit` checkboxes/radios clipped ("Errors only" → "Errors") | `cellSize` accounts for the ≥18pt indicator and the label gap |
| Multi-line labels and `NSAlert` informative text showed one line | `titleRectForBounds:` keeps the full rect for labels that need (and have room for) more lines |
| Password field text sat 10pt left of other fields' text | same subclass fix (`NSSecureTextFieldCell`) |
| ThemeDemo stuck at 2× after a `capture-theme-demo.sh --scale 2` run | the script passes `-GSScaleFactor`/`-GSTheme` as launch arguments |
| Bold text (`boldSystemFontOfSize:`, title bar, table headers) drew in DejaVu Sans Bold | the theme sets `NSBoldFont` to the interface font's bold face (`Cantarell_700wght`) |
| With `NSWindows95InterfaceStyle`, windows created after launch had no menu bar (GNUstep bug, upstream issue 2) | the theme attaches the main menu when a window that can become main, and has no menu, becomes key or main |
| Demo and capture scripts tested the installed theme (`-GSTheme Adwaita`), which was from Jul 27 | they pass the built bundle by absolute path (`--theme`/`ADWAITA_THEME` to override) and no longer save `GSTheme` in ThemeDemo's defaults |
| Table headers were bold, centred, on a grey band with separators | libadwaita style: small bold text in a dim colour (full colour for a clicked or sorted column), on the list's background, no separators; GNUstep's default centred titles start at the leading edge, lined up with the rows' text |
| Every table drew horizontal grid lines | grid lines only when the app asks (`setGridStyleMask:`/`setDrawsGrid:`, including tables decoded from a nib or Gorm file); GNUstep's own default of drawing a grid is treated as none, the GNOME and Cocoa default |
| Table scroll views had a bezel frame and lines between content and scrollers | no frame; the space is filled with the table's background, so the list reads as one plain area (other scroll views keep their frame) |
| Scrollers drew a grey track with a faint knob | overlay-style indicator: no track, a thin dim slider along the outer edge, thicker and darker while dragged; hidden when nothing overflows |
| A dark grey line under every toolbar | toolbars sit on the window background with a light bottom edge (the palette's `toolbarBackgroundColor`/`toolbarBorderColor`; GSTheme looked for them in a ThemeExtra colour list and fell back to dark grey) |
| Toolbar buttons had no hover or pressed look (pressed labels turned white) | libadwaita flat-button backgrounds: the text colour at 7% under the pointer, 16% pressed, 6pt corners; hover comes from tracking rects the theme adds in `-[GSToolbarButton layout]` |
| The menu bar started with the app's name, greyed when its menu was empty ("OneDriveServiceManager") | an empty app menu is removed; a non-empty one is drawn as GNOME's main-menu icon (☰) |
| `NSMenuItemCell` overrides used the exact-class lookup, and pop-up buttons' layout depended on it failing | they use `GnomeThemeOriginalMethod()`; pop-up button cells get their geometry explicitly, so an upstream fix to `-overriddenMethod:for:` can't move pop-up titles |
| Under GNOME Wayland, tool tips and drag images showed only the first time (GNOME/mutter#5080, upstream items 5 and 6) | on Wayland the tool tip panel and the drag window are ordered out without first being shrunk to `NSZeroRect`; elsewhere GNUstep's shrink is kept |
| A focused push button (OneDriveServiceManager's Cancel, the first key view in its panels) had a ring around its title and blue fragments in its corners | NSCell's inner ring is no longer drawn for buttons, and the button's own ring runs just inside its edge, like libadwaita's (a ring outside the frame was clipped to the corners); as in GTK (focus-visible), rings on buttons, checkboxes, radios and sliders show only after a key press and hide on a pointer press, while text fields keep theirs whenever focused |
| Table rows were about 28px (GNUstep's default 16pt clipped the text) with 3–4px of text inset | tables built in code start with GTK's list density: 34pt rows (scaled with the interface font) and no intercell spacing; table cells and headers inset their text 6px, as GTK list cells do; apps that set a row height or spacing keep theirs, and nib/Gorm tables keep their archived values |
| Toolbars showed icon and label; GNOME header bars show icons with tool tips | a toolbar the app gives no display mode starts icon-only (later toolbars with its identifier copy it); a button without its label gets the label as its tool tip unless the item has one; `setDisplayMode:` and nib/Gorm toolbars are respected |
| The ☰ main menu sat at the start of the menu bar; GNOME puts it at the end | its rect moves to the right end of the bar (`-[NSMenuView rectOfItemAtIndex:]`), which drawing, hit testing and highlighting follow; its menu opens right-aligned under it |
| Alerts had GNUstep's layout: app icon, left title, a groove line, buttons at the right | laid out like `AdwAlertDialog`: no icon or line, a centred bold heading (title-2 size) over centred body text, and 44pt buttons of equal width in a row (stacked full width when the titles don't fit), default button at the right |
| Tab views drew pill tabs with a blue top bar and no frame | GtkNotebook style: a 1px frame, plain text tabs on the window background, a 4pt accent underline under the selected tab, content on the view background (tab views built in code now draw their background, Cocoa's default) |
| Checkbox and radio labels sat 10pt after the indicator | 4pt, GTK's spacing (about 5px before the first glyph) |
| Cocoa apps' application menu (the main menu's first item, usually untitled or "NewApplication") showed as a blank or wrongly named item, with GSTheme's own empty app menu beside it | an untitled first item, the menu passed to `setAppleMenu:` (a no-op in GNUstep), a nib's `_NSAppleMenu`, or a first menu holding About or Hide is named after the app, so GSTheme adopts it and it becomes the ☰ menu |
| Hide, Hide Others and Show All were offered, but GNOME has no hidden apps: `-hide:` orders the windows out and relies on GNUstep's app icon to bring them back (with `GSSuppressAppIcon` it leaves the windows up and puts an icon tile on the desktop) | they are left out of the application menu, with the separators they leave doubled |
| In a narrow window whose menu items overflow the bar (Gorm's document window), ☰ covered the last items | it moves to the end only when every item fits; otherwise it stays first |
| Gorm's document toolbar (Objects, Images, Sounds, Classes, File) lost its labels to the icon-only default | a toolbar whose delegate lists selectable items is a view switcher, which GNOME shows with icon and label, so it keeps them; an app that sets a mode itself is left alone |
| Switches with the box after the title (`imagePosition` NSImageRight, all over Gorm's inspectors: "Command [ ]") drew the box first | the indicator goes at the end and the title before it, in the cell's alignment |
| Grooved and bezelled boxes (Gorm's inspectors) had blue edges | `controlHighlightColor`/`controlLightHighlightColor` are the light edges of GNUstep's 3D bevels, not selection colours: white in the light palette, a light grey in the dark one |
| Box titles drawn by an `NSTextFieldCell` (Gorm's "Type", "Options", "Alignment") came out upside down | text in a cell drawn by a non-flipped view (an NSBox) is drawn with string drawing; flipping the context by hand mirrored the glyphs |
| `NSForm` entries (Gorm's "Title:" fields) were white boxes | the entry is drawn as an Adwaita entry; NSFormCell filled it with `textBackgroundColor` after the border |
| Gorm and nib layouts clipped at GNOME's font size ("Miniaturize" as "Miniatur") | compact metrics for apps with a main Gorm or nib file: GNUstep's 12pt, regular button titles, GNUstep's button margins and tab height, 14pt indicators; `GnomeThemeMetrics` (`gnome`/`compact`) overrides the choice per app (see the README) |
| Menu bar titles were about 37px apart; GTK's are about 20px | about 22px, so narrow windows (Gorm's document window) fit their menus |
| GNOME apps have no menu bar | `GnomeThemeMenuStyle = primary` (a user default, or the app's Info.plist) turns it into GNOME's main menu button: at the end of the toolbar when the window shows one (the toolbar is narrowed for it), otherwise alone in a slim bar; it shows a copy of the main menu (the menus, then the application menu's items) right-aligned under the button, rebuilt each time it opens |
| An app laid out in Gorm for GNOME's metrics would get compact metrics (it has a main nib) | apps can declare `GnomeThemeMetrics` in their Info.plist; the user's default still wins |
| Gorm's palettes make controls at GNUstep's sizes (22pt buttons) | `Palettes/Adwaita`: a Gorm palette of controls at GNOME's sizes, with fonts left at the system font's default size so they follow the app's metrics (checked: archived at 12pt in a compact process, read back at 14.7pt in a GNOME one) |
| The header bar was drawn at 1× with a scale factor (`GSScaleFactor 2`: a 23pt bar), and the content sat 1pt off (gap at the left and bottom) | offsets and the minimum width are in device pixels, scaled by the factor; `-[GSWindowDecorationView layout]` places the content from an origin `+contentRectForFrameRect:styleMask:` leaves unscaled (a GNUstep bug that also shifts its own title bar), which the header bar corrects |
| In Arabic, Hebrew and other right-to-left languages the header bar kept its left-to-right order | mirrored as GTK mirrors it (checked against a GTK render): button-layout's start at the right, close outermost at the left, ☰ to the right of the buttons; the direction comes from the first preferred language (`NSForceRightToLeftWritingDirection` forces it) |
| Right and middle clicks on the header bar did nothing; the double-click actions "menu" and "lower" did nothing | GNOME's `action-right-click-titlebar` (default: the window menu), `action-middle-click-titlebar` and all double-click actions: "lower" orders the window back, "menu" opens a window menu with the entries of Mutter's that GNUstep can carry out (Hide, Maximize/Restore, Always on Top, Close), which stays open after the click |
| Header bar windows couldn't be dragged past the screen's edge or to the top to maximise, and got none of Mutter's snapping, tiling or Super-drag | on X11 the header bar hands moves and resizes to the window manager (`_NET_WM_MOVERESIZE`, after GTK's 8px drag threshold), asks it to maximise and restore (`_NET_WM_STATE`), shows its window menu on right-click (`_GTK_SHOW_WINDOW_MENU`) and reads its maximised state for the restore icon, as GTK does (`Source/Adapters/GnomeThemeWindowManager.m`, Xlib through `GSDisplayServer`'s `-serverDevice` and `-windowDevice:`); its own loops and menu remain for window managers without these |
| Mutter refused to move, maximise, minimise or close windows GNUstep decorates, even when asked (libs-back's `_MOTIF_WM_HINTS` allow no functions: proposal item 0) | once the X window exists, the header bar rewrites the hints: no decorations, and the functions the window's style allows |
| The header bar in high contrast looked as in the normal palette | libadwaita's high contrast details: a 1px ring round each window button's circle and a darker window border |
| Clicking ☰ opened its menu and the release closed it again (libs-gui 0.32, upstream item 8) | the menu opens on the click's release and stays open until a click picks an item or lands outside it; Escape closes it |
| With `GSX11HandlesWindowDecorations NO`, GNUstep drew a NeXT title bar (black, round miniaturise and close buttons, resizable only from a bottom bar) | libadwaita's header bar, measured against libadwaita 1.7 renders (`Reference/HeaderBar`): 46pt including a 1px window border, bold centred title (shifted clear of the buttons when they're in the way, shortened with an ellipsis), round 34pt window buttons with Adwaita's icons in `button-layout` order, ☰ before them with the primary menu, title and icons dimmed when the window isn't key; moving by the bar, resizing from every edge and corner (5pt strips inside the border), and the `action-double-click-titlebar` action, with maximise going back to the frame before. The theme can't turn this on itself: the backend reads the flag before the theme loads. Alerts (alone or as sheets) have no bar, as AdwAlertDialog: a border only. Panels get the bar with a close button; windows with buttons and no title get the bar without one; borderless windows and `NSFullScreenWindowMask` get neither bar nor border |
| Push buttons narrower than their padding clipped short titles (ScreenshotTool's 64pt "12" drew as "1", a 44pt "20" drew nothing: plugins-themes-Adwaita#3) | rounded buttons are padded once (GTK's 17px, from the bezel margins), not again by the title rect; in a frame too narrow for it the padding shrinks to 4pt before the title is cut; `sizeToFit` buttons are about 15pt narrower |
| Steppers at Cocoa's size (about 19x27pt) drew "−" and "+" side by side in 9pt each (plugins-themes-Adwaita#6) | a stepper taller than it is wide has an up half above a down half, with chevrons; wider ones keep GTK's spin button "−" and "+"; a button that can't change the value is dimmed, as in GTK |
| Colour wells drew NeXT's bevelled well (plugins-themes-Adwaita#2) | GTK's colour button: the theme's push button (pressed while the colour panel is attached) holding a rounded swatch with a faint inner border |
| Tool tips were GNUstep's pale yellow box with a black border (plugins-themes-Adwaita#1) | libadwaita's: dark (80% black over the window background, in every palette), white text, 6px by 10px padding, no border (a white one in high contrast); square corners, rounded where the window has an alpha channel (see the row on menus and tool tips) |
| Clicking a menu bar title (and the bar's ☰) opened its menu and the release closed it again (libs-gui 0.32, upstream item 8; plugins-themes-Adwaita#5) | first fixed by opening the menu on the release; now as GTK's menu bar (see the row on menu tracking) |
| With the menu bar style, every window that could become main got the app's menus, Preferences windows included (ScreenshotTool's: plugins-themes-Adwaita#4) | windows titled Preferences or Settings get no menu bar or ☰ (unless they're the app's only window that can be main); a window delegate's `-windowShouldShowMenuBar:` decides instead when it's implemented (README, "Windows without the menu bar") |
| Toolbars were libs-gui's fixed heights: 62pt with labels (empty ones included), about 40pt icon only; views taller than 32pt (GNOME's 34pt buttons) disappeared; images were forced to 32x32; view items' labels were black, unreadable in the dark palette (plugins-themes-Adwaita#8, upstream item 9) | with GNOME metrics, items are sized from their content: libadwaita's 46pt row with 34pt buttons for icons or labels alone, an icon over a caption-sized label otherwise (no label row for empty labels), images at their own size up to 24pt (16pt small), views kept with the row growing to fit; every item gets the row's height; labels in the text colour. Compact metrics keep libs-gui's layout |
| The selected segment of a segmented control was 2/255 darker than the others in the dark palette, and only a little darker in the light one (plugins-themes-Adwaita#7) | libadwaita's checked linked button: the text colour at 30% over the window background, darker in the light palette and lighter in the dark one; checked in the light, dark and high contrast runs |
| Toolbar items with a custom view and no `-sizeToFit` (ScreenshotTool's colour, Copy, Preferences and zoom items) shrank to nothing (plugins-themes-Adwaita#9) | libs-gui sets each view to its slot less 10pt insets after every layout; the theme gives it back its slot less its own 3pt insets, within the item's minSize and maxSize |
| Menu shortcuts touched the menu's right edge (plugins-themes-Adwaita#10) | shortcuts and submenu arrows end 12pt inside the row, as in libadwaita's popover menus |
| Menu separators were two rows of mid grey (plugins-themes-Adwaita#11) | one hairline on a pixel row, the text colour at 15% over the menu (50% in high contrast) |
| Menu bar menus opened on the release; a click outside reached the window under it; context menus closed when the right button came up; Escape didn't close context menus | audited against GTK 4 under Mutter: menu bar titles and context menus open on the press and stay open on its release (on 0.32 the theme drops that release, as master does; master is told by `-[NSImage isTemplate]`); a press outside closes them and goes nowhere else; Escape closes the menu bar's, ☰ and context menus. ☰ opens on the release, as GTK's menu buttons do |
| A click on a pop-up button opened its menu and closed it again at once, keeping the current item (from the second click on: the first time, making the menu's window let the release come before the tracking) | pop-up menus open on the press and get the menu bar's treatment: the opening click's release is ignored (`-doesProcessEventsForPopUpMenu` in master, dropped by the theme in 0.32), Escape or a press outside closes them; QuirkProbe `popup-click-stays-open` |
| With libs-gui master (gui ff49ac8) alerts were right-aligned, table header titles sat centred (about 110pt in) and menu shortcuts were centred (30pt from the edge): master (3237efda8) numbers `NSTextAlignment` as AppKit does, swapping centre and right, so the constants of a theme built against 0.32 meant the other alignment | `GnomeThemeCenterTextAlignment()` and `GnomeThemeRightTextAlignment()` take the values from `NSParagraphStyle`'s class version (4 since the change); QuirkProbe passes against 0.32 and master, its alert check measuring the heading's ink |
| Menus drew rounded corners on an opaque window, black under a compositor | square, with the border, unless the window has an alpha channel and a compositing manager runs; then menus (10pt) and tool tips (libadwaita's 9pt, with its light outline) are rounded. The alpha channel needs the libs-back patch (`GSBackBorderlessWindowAlpha`) |
| Window managers saw context and pop-up menus as dialogs (Mutter focused them, drawing their window unfocused), tool tips as dialogs (libs-gui#965), alerts as normal windows and menu bar menus as torn-off menus (plugins-themes-Adwaita#15) | the theme types windows as GTK does (`GnomeThemeWindowTypes.m`): `_TOOLTIP`, `_DROPDOWN_MENU` for an in-window menu bar's menus, `_POPUP_MENU` for other menus, `_DND`, and `_DIALOG` for alerts and open and save panels. It reads the type first and writes only a different one, so with the libs-back patch (item 5, which types all but the menu bar's menus itself) it mostly does nothing. QuirkProbe `window-types`; `make check-mutter` `menu-type` |
| With the toolbar in the header bar, an item whose view acts only on the release (ScreenshotTool's Copy, zoom and colour items) did nothing: its press went up to the bar, which read up to the release to see whether it was a drag (plugins-themes-Adwaita#33) | the bar leaves a press that came from a toolbar item's view alone, so the release reaches the item; only the bar's background and spaces drag the window, as in GTK. QuirkProbe `header-bar-toolbar-item-click` |
| A document window's header bar showed GNUstep's "white.png  --  ~/Pictures", pushing the name aside (plugins-themes-Adwaita#31) | when the title is the one `-setTitleWithRepresentedFilename:` made, the bar shows the file's display name and the folder as a tool tip over it (AdwWindowTitle's subtitle); other titles are untouched. QuirkProbe `header-bar-document-title` |
| GNOME apps keep their toolbar's buttons in the header bar | `GnomeThemeHeaderBarToolbar` (a user default, or the app's Info.plist) puts the window's toolbar in the header bar's row: items before its flexible space at the start, after it at the end, the title in the space; icons without labels; the » menu for items that don't fit; mirrored right to left |

Regression checks for these live in `Examples/QuirkProbe`; run
`make check-quirks` (see the README).

## GNOME-native polish

The six items found side by side with the libadwaita reference (row density,
icon-only toolbars, the main menu's position, alerts, tab views and checkbox
spacing) are in the Fixed table. Still different from GNOME:

- **Packing of option groups.** GTK stacks checkboxes and radios tighter
  than most GNUstep layouts; that spacing belongs to the app.
- **Text width.** ([#23](https://github.com/danjboyd/plugins-themes-Adwaita/issues/23)) At the same font and size, GNUstep's text runs about 5%
  wider than GTK's, so a paragraph can wrap a line earlier (seen in alerts).
- **Alerts keep a title bar.** ([#22](https://github.com/danjboyd/plugins-themes-Adwaita/issues/22)) `AdwAlertDialog` has none; GNUstep's panel
  has the window manager's.
- **Tool tips are opaque.** ([#21](https://github.com/danjboyd/plugins-themes-Adwaita/issues/21)) libadwaita's are translucent (80% black). The
  theme paints the colour that makes over the window background; with the
  libs-back patch and a compositor they are rounded, still opaque.
- **Menus have no shadow,** ([#19](https://github.com/danjboyd/plugins-themes-Adwaita/issues/19)) and 10pt corners where libadwaita's popover
  menus have 15px corners and a soft shadow.
- **Context menus open at the pointer;** ([#20](https://github.com/danjboyd/plugins-themes-Adwaita/issues/20)) GTK's open just below it.

## Gorm and other nib-based apps

Found putting Gorm through its paces (its palettes, inspectors and document
window, compared with the GNUstep theme). Still open:

- **Compact metrics are per app.** ([#24](https://github.com/danjboyd/plugins-themes-Adwaita/issues/24)) A code-built app that also loads Gorm
  or nib windows gets GNOME's metrics for all of them; it can set
  `GnomeThemeMetrics` to `compact`.
- **Menu bars in very narrow windows** ([#25](https://github.com/danjboyd/plugins-themes-Adwaita/issues/25)) can still run past the edge; ☰ stays
  first so the application menu is always reachable.
- **Designing for GNOME's metrics in Gorm** ([#26](https://github.com/danjboyd/plugins-themes-Adwaita/issues/26)) means running Gorm with
  `-GnomeThemeMetrics gnome`, where its own inspectors are cramped. The
  Adwaita palette (`Palettes/Adwaita`, see the README) provides controls at
  GNOME's sizes; roomier inspectors would need changes in Gorm itself.
- **Gorm's CustomView palette item** ([#27](https://github.com/danjboyd/plugins-themes-Adwaita/issues/27)) draws as a pale disabled button instead
  of a dark tile.

## Theme follow-ups

- **Scrollbars that hide until needed.** ([#17](https://github.com/danjboyd/plugins-themes-Adwaita/issues/17)) libadwaita shows its overlay
  indicators only after the pointer moves or the view scrolls, widens them
  under the pointer, and lets content run underneath. GNUstep's
  `NSTrackingArea` is declared but not wired into `NSView`, so hover needs
  legacy tracking rects kept up to date by hand, and content under the
  scrollers needs `-[NSScrollView tile]` changes. The indicator stays visible
  while content overflows, in a strip of its own.

- **Install after merging.** Apps load `~/GNUstep/Library/Themes/Adwaita.theme`.
  On 2026-09-24 that copy was from Jul 27, and all of OneDriveServiceManager's
  quirks (clipped titles, invisible toolbar items, one-line labels and alerts)
  came from it. Run `make install GNUSTEP_INSTALLATION_DOMAIN=USER` after each
  merge.
- **Remove workarounds when upstream fixes land.** ([#28](https://github.com/danjboyd/plugins-themes-Adwaita/issues/28)) The probe's
  `toolbar-view-item-image` check reports PASS instead of KNOWN once libs-gui
  stops clearing view images. Also drop `GnomeThemeOriginalMethod()`'s fallback
  when `-overriddenMethod:for:` walks superclasses, `-windowNeedsMainMenu:`
  when libs-gui attaches the menu to late windows, and the toolbar button
  tracking rects if libs-gui starts tracking for
  `showsBorderOnlyWhileMouseInside`. Drop the `GSTTPanel` and
  `GSDragView` overrides once Mutter thaws unmapped windows (GNOME/mutter#5080)
  or libs-gui stops shrinking them (libs-gui#964). When a libs-gui release
  sizes toolbar items from their content (upstream item 9), drop the
  toolbar layout overrides (`GSToolbarButton`/`GSToolbarBackView` -layout,
  `GSToolbarView -_handleBackViewsFrame`). Once no supported libs-gui
  release lacks a84b42471 (upstream item 8), drop the release-dropping
  `-[NSApplication nextEventMatchingMask:...]` hook for 0.32 in
  GnomeThemePrimaryMenu.m (keep the Escape timer and the press outside:
  GNUstep's menu tracking ignores keys and passes that press on).
- **High contrast as current GNOME does it.** ([#18](https://github.com/danjboyd/plugins-themes-Adwaita/issues/18)) The theme's high contrast
  palette is white on black, chosen by a `gtk-theme` name containing
  "HighContrast" (GNOME 3's). GNOME now sets
  `org.gnome.desktop.a11y.interface high-contrast`, and libadwaita keeps
  the light or dark palette with stronger borders and outlines. The header
  bar draws libadwaita's details in whichever palette is active.

## GNUstep issues to report upstream

Confirmed on 2026-09-24 with a minimal program under the default theme, both on
the installed gui 0.32.0 / base 1.31.1 and on master (gui ff49ac8, base
a8dd1b8). Draft issues and their programs are in `Docs/upstream-issues/`. Drafts 2 and 4, still to file, are tracked in [#29](https://github.com/danjboyd/plugins-themes-Adwaita/issues/29).

1. **libs-gui: a toolbar view item loses its view's image.** Not filed:
   fixed by [libs-gui#952](https://github.com/gnustep/libs-gui/pull/952),
   which we confirmed on 2026-10-02. The cause is
   `-[NSToolbarItem _layout]`. It re-applies the item's own image, which is
   nil for a view item, and `GSToolbarBackView -setImage:` passes that nil to
   the view. The item isn't copied or archived. Workaround: also call
   `[item setImage:]` with the view's image.
2. **libs-gui: `NSWindows95InterfaceStyle` windows created after launch get
   no menu bar.** The menu reaches windows only through
   `-updateAllWindowsWithMenu:`, which runs when the main menu changes. Seen
   under GNOME/Mutter and under Xvfb. This theme works around it
   (`-[GnomeTheme windowNeedsMainMenu:]`); elsewhere, apps call
   `[window setMenu: [NSApp mainMenu]]`.
3. **libs-base: the main dispatch queue is drained only in
   `NSDefaultRunLoopMode`.** Filed as
   [gnustep/libs-base#806](https://github.com/gnustep/libs-base/issues/806). Main-queue blocks stall in the modal-panel and
   event-tracking modes, so they wait while a sheet, a modal panel or menu
   tracking is active (`NSRunLoop.m`, where the drainer is registered).
4. **libs-gui: `-[GSTheme overriddenMethod:for:]` matches only the receiver's
   exact class.** An override reached from a subclass gets 0 and can't call
   the original. This was the root cause of the invisible toolbar items; the
   theme works around it with `GnomeThemeOriginalMethod()`.

Found on 2026-09-25 while tracking down tool tips that show only once under
GNOME Wayland. Confirmed on master (gui ff49ac8, back 5db2ae7) and on the
installed 0.32.0, using the default theme.

5. **Mutter: an Xwayland window resized and then unmapped stays frozen.**
   Filed as [GNOME/mutter#5080](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/mutter/-/issues/5080).
   Mutter freezes commits on a resize and thaws them only after it next
   paints the window, which never happens if the window is unmapped first.
   `_XWAYLAND_ALLOW_COMMITS` stays 0 and the window is blank when mapped
   again. Reproduced with plain Xlib (`xwayland_resize_unmap.c`); this is the
   root cause.
6. **libs-gui: tool tips shrink the visible panel before ordering it out.**
   Filed as [gnustep/libs-gui#964](https://github.com/gnustep/libs-gui/issues/964).
   `-[GSToolTips _endDisplay:]` sets `NSZeroRect` and then orders out, which
   triggers item 5 on every hide. Without the shrink, tool tips showed every
   time. `GSDragView` does the same, and drag images are affected too.
7. **libs-gui: `_initBackendWindow` sets the level before the window is
   registered.** Filed as
   [gnustep/libs-gui#965](https://github.com/gnustep/libs-gui/issues/965). The backend can't identify the tool tip panel, so it types
   it `_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DIALOG` instead of `_TOOLTIP`. The theme sets
   `_TOOLTIP` itself, and the libs-back patch types the window again just
   before mapping it (`Docs/PROPOSAL_LIBS_BACK_CSD.md`, item 5).

Found on 2026-09-25 while building the header bar; already fixed on master.

8. **libs-gui: a click on a menu title closes the menu on the release.** In
   gui 0.32.0 every mouse up ends menu tracking (commit 82717eefe), so
   menu bar menus and ☰ closed as soon as the click that opened them was
   released. Fixed on master by a84b42471; not in a release yet. The theme
   works around it for ☰ (see `8-libs-gui-menu-click-closes-fixed-on-master.md`).

9. **libs-gui: toolbar heights are fixed constants** ([libs-gui#972](https://github.com/gnustep/libs-gui/issues/972)). Items get a 60pt (50pt
   small) slot whatever their content, empty labels still take a label row,
   views taller than 32pt are removed and images are made 32x32; there's no
   theme hook. The theme lays toolbars out itself with GNOME metrics (see
   `9-libs-gui-toolbar-fixed-heights.md`, with the repro `toolbar_heights.m`).

### Reported by OneDriveServiceManager: withdrawn

OneDriveServiceManager rechecked these on 2026-09-24 with the current theme
installed. None is a GNUstep bug; don't report them upstream.

- **A label holding one long "word" (a path) draws nothing.** Its text was
  four leading spaces and then the path. GNUstep wrapped at the spaces and
  put the path on a second line, which the one-line frame hid. Expected
  behaviour.
- **A pop-up button with the focus takes Return.** The window had no default
  button cell, only a button with a Return key equivalent.
  `setDefaultButtonCell:` fixes it, matching the probe.
- **Return/Esc key equivalents stop working after another panel closes.**
  Seen only with xdotool's synthetic events, sent to a window that had lost
  the focus. Not a proven bug. Calling `makeKeyAndOrderFront:` on the window
  again is still good UX.
- **The toolbar view-item image loss is not caused by copying or archiving**
  (OneDriveServiceManager's first guess). Upstream item 1 above gives the real
  cause. OneDriveServiceManager now uses plain image items, so it no longer
  needs the workaround.
