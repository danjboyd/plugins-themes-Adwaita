# GCC check for anything sent to GNUstep (Docs/UPSTREAM_POLICY.md): GNUstep
# also builds with GCC, whose Objective-C front end has no blocks, no
# object literals, no properties' dot syntax and no ARC, and treats a
# method it hasn't seen declared as returning id.  Clang, which builds
# GNUstep here, accepts all of these.
#
# Runs GCC's Objective-C front end, syntax only, over each .m and .c file
# a commit range adds or changes, and fails if GCC reports anything in the
# file itself that it didn't already report for the same file before the
# change.  The installed GNUstep headers were built for clang and
# libobjc2 and GCC can't parse all of them, so diagnostics inside headers
# are ignored: this checks our code, it is not a full GCC build.
#
# Before anything else it shows GCC rejecting a planted array literal and
# block with the same flags; if it doesn't, the check proves nothing and
# the script stops.
#
# Usage:
#   gcc-syntax-check.sh <repository> [<base>] [<ref>]
#       the files changed between <base> (default origin/master) and <ref>
#       (default HEAD) of a GNUstep repository
#   gcc-syntax-check.sh --files <file>...
#       the given files as they are on disk (an issue's reproducer)
#
# Exit status: 0 clean, 1 new diagnostics, 2 the check couldn't run.
